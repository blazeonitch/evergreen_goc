#NOTE.
```markdown
    Please do not remove my github link from the footer. Also don't edit the websites's metadata
```

### Now host on any server you want! 


# Do this only after hosting.

Once hosted on a platform e.g. netlify, github. and there is an appropiate domain name e.g 'evergreengroupofcompanies.com', edit index.html to setup google's recaptcha to avoid spam of the contact form.  

Make sure this is uncommented in the form.
    
```html
    <form action="?" method="POST">
        <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6Lebr44rAAAAAHCwU4VqvQQ2KqwJX12B5XfsPBSl"></div>
        <br />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
```
### Then, add the website's URL to google recaptcha dev console.

Login into the company email and open google recaptcha website, there's already a 'campaign' for this company on it, make sure the data-sitekey matches that on g-recaptcha.  

save and redeploy.
